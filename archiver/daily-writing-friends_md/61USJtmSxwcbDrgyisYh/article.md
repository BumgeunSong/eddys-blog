Today, I talked with ChatGPT about my career decision. That was in English. Maybe isn't it nice to make some change in my daily writing?

So I wrote in english with AI's help.

===

I’m an iOS developer learning web frontend.

Not to leave mobile behind, but to contribute more to early-stage products.

A few days ago, my iOS team lead said. (not exactly, interpreted in my word)

“You’ve got strong soft skills. But most managers tend to look for deep expertise — architecture, frameworks, language. If you go multi-stack, some might see you as a ‘master of none.’"

"You might as well make <strong>your own product win</strong>. To prove that you are in different track."

That hit me. I've been believed 'Skills are the tools'. But to convince other people, I need to build something matter. That is what really speaks.
